# SchedulerBay Application

## Microsoft Engage'21 Submission

### üö© Overview

#### ‚Ä£ Problem Statement
<p align="justify">

Build a functional prototype of a platform that gives students an array of digital academic and social tools to stay engaged with their studies, peers and broader university community during pandemic.

#### ‚Ä£ Proposed Solution
<p align="justify">
A Scheduler Application to bring hybrid mode of classes to life. With the ease in restrictions wrt Covid-19, many organizations have started to implement hybrid mode of classes which allows a certain number of students to attend classes in offline mode. This webapp helps in organizing the same by allowing students to submit weekly preferences for attending classes in offline mode. The seat allocation done on FCFS basis, will eventually provide a roster of students attending in offline mode to the faculty. <br><br>
This project has been solely built during the period of <b>Microsoft Engage'21 Mentorship Program</b> <i>conducted by Microsoft</i> from the period of 8th November 2021 to 26th November 2021.

### üö© End Notes

These 3 weeks turned out to have a very steep learning curve for me. I would like to thank my mentor for their utmost support and help during the program and to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft">Microsoft</a> for providing students with an enriching program such as this!
